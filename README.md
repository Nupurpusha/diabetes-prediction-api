## Overview:
This FastAPI application is a machine learning model deployment project. The API provides an endpoint to predict diabetes based on input features such as Pregnancies, Glucose level, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin level, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age. The model utilized is a pre-trained Random Forest classifier stored in a pickle file.
